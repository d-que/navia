# **NaViA Documentation**

## **Changelog**

### **v 0.3**

#### **New features**

- **Figure options/exports**: under Figure options/export new visiual options can be found including hiding/showing of ticks, grid and labels. The save button allows to save a figure with 4k resolution (3840x2160) and options to select windows by hand
- **Positive and negative mode** for mass calculation are implemented
- **Series: redesigned menu**. Added background series which works as an eraser, so ranges can be marked as background and peaks can be deleted
- **Background colour set to transparent** for easier usage of spectra in PPTs



### **How to use NaViA:**

Here are some instructions 

#### **Required file format:**

The mz-file should be in a format of a CSV file like below:

Mass	Intensity
990.014550	0.000000
990.044094	0.000000
990.073639	0.000000
990.103185	0.000000
999.836240	0.000000
999.866225	0.000000
999.896210	0.000000
999.926197	0.000000
999.956186	0.712933

...

When loading a file the first ten lines are skipped for preventing errors from overhead of "Export exact mass" from XCalibur. For native MS, these values are highly unlikely to contain valueable information.
